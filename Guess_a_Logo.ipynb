        "*   The reconstructed logos were correctly displayed by iterating through a selection, reshaping the 1D logo data into 2D images, normalizing pixel values, and plotting them in a grid layout using a grayscale colormap.\n",

        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   The successful reconstruction and visualization of the logos confirm that the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) captured essential features, allowing for their regeneration from a reduced dimensionality representation.\n",
